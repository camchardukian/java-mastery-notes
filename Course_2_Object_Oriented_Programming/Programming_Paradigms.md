# Intro To Programming Paradigms

In object-oriented programming we bring together the data and methods that operate on said data inside a single object.

In functional programming we take the opposite approach. We assume that the data and behavior are fundamentally different so we keep them separate.

## Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming

Object oriented programming can assist us with reducing complexity, easier maintenance, code reuse, and faster development.

# Scanner

In Java, the `Scanner` class is part of the `java.utils` package.

This class is used for reading input from various sources such as files or user input from the keyboard.

It has several methods for extracting data such as:

- **nextBoolean**
- **nextByte**
- **nextDouble**
- **nextFloat**
- **nextInt**
- **nextLine**
- **nextLong**
- **nextShort**

When we're finished using the scanner we should run `scanner.close();` to release any resources associated with the scanner.
